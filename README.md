# MG-ACO
Ant Colony Optimization for test models generation in model transformation testing

## Source code and the Mutation Analysis for the ACO Approach for Test Case Generation 

This project contains the implementation of ACO approach to generate metamodel instances in the context of model transfromation testing. Also, this project supports and verifies the mutation analysis performed in [1]. It has been developed with Eclipse Modeling Tools, version IDE 2020-06 (4.16.0). MDE Testing Framework [2], anATLyzer [3] and ATL plugin are needed.

### ACO
There is a folder named MG-ACO contating the ACO approach to generate test models. Folder "src" contains the source code written in Java 11. Folder "Inputs", contais the input metamodels in which models should be generated from. For instance "Families.ecore" that is the case study described in [1], is located in this folder. Folder "Moldes" will hold generated models after running the ACO. For instance, there are four models that conform to "Families.ecore" described in [1] resulting from ACO execution.

### Mutation Analysis

This project contains the mutation analysis performed on five case studies explained in [1]. Folders “analysis_approachName” contain all the artifacts regarding each of the case studies. For instance, there are three zip files namely ACO, Viatra and Random which refer to mutation analysis of the approaches. In each approach, the name of case study can be found and in the approach folder, there are thirty folders each for different independent experiments named like ”Run-xx”. In each Run, there is a folder named models contains the model generated by related approach and other three folders, namely zoo, mottu and wimmer refer typing, semantic and syntax mutants, respectively [2]. Mutants, mutant-killing models and sample of output models resulting from the running of the mutants can be found in each related folder. 

In order to re-execute results with the different case studies and the different mutants, some lines of code in [2] must be commented and uncommented. After doing so, the class can be executed by right-clicking and selecting Run As -> JUnit Plug-in Test. The code in this Java class contains explanations for executing each case study, for instance:

```java
String testcase = "Grafcet2PetriNet";
String[] metamodelFiles = new String[] { metamodel(testcase, "Grafcet.ecore"), metamodel(testcase, "PetriNet.ecore") };
String[] metamodelNames = new String[] { "Grafcet", "PetriNet" };	
AtlTransformation trafo = AtlTransformation.fromFile(trafo("Grafcet2PetriNet", "Grafcet2PetriNet.atl"), metamodelFiles, metamodelNames);
```

After executing the program, some information will be displayed in the console. At the end, it indicates the file with the result of the mutation analysis. This is a TXT file named "Report" that is located in each case study folder of the containing the average result of model transformation mutants of the corresponding analysis_caseStudyName folder.
